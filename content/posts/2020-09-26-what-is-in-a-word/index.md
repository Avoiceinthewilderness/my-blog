Words are what are seen and known. It is how we learn to know and how we teach others to know. I I have been obsessed with the written word for most of my life. As a child it began with VC Andrews and the Attic Series. It extended into music of my times, which seem to be making their way back into my life as I saw my daughter wearing a Pink Floyd shirt the other day. She had never heard one of their songs so I quickly pulled up my playlist and gave her a taste. I could tell she wasn’t moved by the words of, Wish YouWere Here, like I was. 

So while a word is what can be seen, it is also something that can be felt. But they are never seen and felt the same, ever. No two people will draw the same image, have the same tug at their heart, see the same humor, are taken back to the same time or have the same hope for the future. There can be a general understanding but ultimately it is an individual happening.

It is my belief that words live. I think of a very short interview-clip on Sirius Radio with Roger Daughtry that I heard,  I am paraphrasing, because I only remember the profoundness of what he said, “when writing a song, you know it’s special because the words aren’t coming from you, they are coming through you.” Like the songs of The Who spoke to me in my teenage years and now speak to me in my relistening it seems the words are alive because now they speak something different. And it cuts to my heart. 

I have spent many years reading and hearing the words written in the Old and New Testament. My obsession with the words took me eventually to a three dimensional place. And I thought, in the gifted songwriter or poet, the creative force has to be like Roger says. I think I have felt that my self when words just start to spill out in my writing. Maybe John in his gospel knew what he was talking about….

> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came to be through him, and without him nothing came to be. What came to be through him was life, and this life was the light of human race; the light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it.”
